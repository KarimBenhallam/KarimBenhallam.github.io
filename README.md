# Welcome to my personal project repository
Hello! <br> <br>
Thank you so much for visiting this repository. Since I already had a repo called {username}.github.io, I decided to just use it for my personal projects. <br><br>
This repo also contains code I provided for assignments back in the second year of my undergrad. Although I do not think it will provide much value, feel free to check those sections as well. <br><br>
I strongly suggest you browse this [website](https://www.karimbenhallam.com 'Personal website') in order to learn more about me, my experience, and the projects this repository contains. Links to each specific sub-projects will be provided as well, so you do not have to navigate from a folder to another.
<br><br>
Thank you!
