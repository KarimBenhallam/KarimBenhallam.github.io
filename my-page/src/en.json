        "wcc": "<p>This job marked my first steps into the professional world. Despite not being a coding position, I had the opportunity to learn a lot during this initial experience. </p><p> I was recruited for two main tasks: creating and updating web content on the University of Ottawa's website (using Drupal) and migrating information from professors' personal pages to a platform called Uniweb. </p><p> This allowed me to develop good habits of professional communication, both oral during meetings and written through emails. I also demonstrated my proactivity by participating in discussion panels for future students, in addition to my existing responsibilities, with the aim of constant progress within my role.",
        "wdev": "<p>During my second job, I was able to put my programming knowledge to the test. I was recruited with the goal of updating the self-help portal available on the Canada Post group of companies' intranet. </p><p> One of the most enjoyable aspects of this second experience was the freedom granted to me by my supervisor to carry out my tasks. This trustful relationship was solidified through productive exchanges, during which I presented the expected results, as well as ideas and perspectives for improvements. </p><p> One significant realization I had was that working on someone else's code is very different from working on your own code. This is something I quickly assimilated and which obviously served me well in my career since. </p><p> The last task I successfully completed was studying the daily traffic on the self-help portals to highlight their importance. I then created an alternative prototype to the conventional solution used up to that point (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), using a technology that is easier to maintain for non-programmers: SharePoint Online. </p><p> Finally, I had the opportunity to present all of this to some executives who were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the work provided by the COOP student I was.",
        "fstack": "<p>By far, my most impactful professional experience. I was recruited alongside another COOP student with the aim of delivering a web application to a client. </p><p> While our supervisor dedicated the majority of his time to another client project, we had a multitude of responsibilities to fulfill. </p><p> I had the fantastic opportunity to work on the project from start to finish, meeting clients, creating requirements and user stories, working on the backend, frontend, application testing, and also being involved in the deployment process. </p><p> Through our daily meetings, numerous pair programming sessions, and weekly sprints, the project followed a methodology blending SCRUM and Extreme Programming. </p><p> I emerged from this internship as a changed engineer, having made significant progress in technical, management, leadership, and various other hard and soft skills. At the beginning of my internship, I had never been exposed to C#, Angular or Azure DevOps, and the initial weeks proved to be quite challenging. However, through resilience and a desire for improvement, I quickly learned the technological stack and became a crucial member of the project. </p><p> I am extremely grateful to my supervisor, Youssef, for giving me this opportunity despite my lack of experience at the time of hiring. I believe I have repaid him with excellent results, a dedicated work ethic, and a positive and vibrant work atmosphere throughout the duration of my internship.",
        "capstone": "<p>My capstone project followed on from my COOP at Conceptio Technologies. Our client was our former requirements engineering professor, and our project was named SELEC (Système d’extraction de liens entre chercheurs, french for System for Extracting Links between Researchers). </p><p> Our client realized that the university had a wealth of data that was not being utilized and made available to research institutes. As applications for research funding became increasingly competitive, we decided to create a product that would leverage this data. The product previously used by the university (Uniweb) was sparsely populated and severely lacked information. </p><p> We quickly became aware of the existence of a recent project at the university called DataHub, and we were the first students to use it. We learned how to communicate with an external team for a common goal, which was not easy at first, but our collaboration with the DataHub team quickly became very positive. </p><p> We created a web application based on Boolean searches to return a list of researchers to the user. The technological stack used was C# for the backend, Angular for the frontend, Azure Synapse for pipelines, and SQL Server for the database. </p><p> The most significant skill I developed during my capstone project was collaboration with an external team. I believe this is an important skill in the professional world, as we often find ourselves working with teams other than our own, and clear communication of common goals is both important and more complex than it may seem. Indeed, other teams may have a different understanding than ours, and that's why I believe my experience during the capstone project has been very valuable. </p><p> At the end of our project, in addition to various presentations and demonstrations in class, we were able to present our product to the Vice-President of the OVPRI (Office of the Vice-President, Research and Innovation), as well as members of various research institutes. They were all pleased with the work done and provided us with feedback and their desire to have access to the application for use. </p><p> Another student is now in charge of closing our project.",
        "ra" : "<p>The only part-time experience on this list. I took over from another student as a research assistant. It's a project to digitize Cham dictionaries (an ancient Vietnamese language), during which I continued the work on Python scripts created by the former occupant of the position. I then created a simple user interface, still in Python, to help merge the two dictionaries into one large dictionary with the minimum possible duplicates. My last task, which I am still working on, is to change the source code of the open-source software named FieldWorks to add a unique feature to our project. </p><p> The technologies I used during this job are Python and C#. </p><p> The skills I had the opportunity to improve include regex, collaboration with an interdisciplinary team not familiar with programming (as they are linguists), as well as communication with FieldWorks developers.",

Originating from the vibrant culture of Morocco, my time here has not only equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of software engineering but has also broadened my perspective through diverse cultural interactions.</p> <p>Being an international student came with its sets of challenges, but also with many lessons that I am extremely grateful for. I was able to adapt to a new environment, embracing Canadian customs without forgetting my own background. If you are not familiar with Morocco, we are a very warm country, weather wise and socially wise. Known for our hospitability, culinary expertise, our diversity of landscapes and languages, we are not only good hosts but also great guests, with the Moroccan diaspora reaching Europe, the Americas and Asia.</p><p>Now that I completed my degree, I am eager to transition into a dynamic professional journey. Armed with a robust skill set, I am ready to apply my knowledge and contribute to the world of software engineering, bridging the insights gained from my Moroccan heritage with the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.</p>",
        "me": "<p>I am Karim Benhallam, a 23-year-old software engineer looking to put my skills to use. </p> <p>I am someone who loves to learn about everything, curious about the world and what it has to offer. I see myself as a very optimistic, positive, and proactive person. Always with a smile on my face, I consider myself to be a go getter. Not afraid of failure or rejection on my quest to absolute expertise, I think my biggest quality is my level of self awareness. I embrace my qualities and work on my shortcomings to become a better person everyday, I also know where I currently stand and where I am headed</p><p>As you visit this web page, you are viewing an example of my strong willingness to learn, as I taught myself React in order to code this website. I frequently put myself outside of my comfort zone in order to make steps towards the long-term success I envision for myself. The biggest example of such behaviour was when I moved to another continent by myself at only 18 years old to pursue a degree which would open the best doors for me. And the most recent examples (other than this website) are when I chose Introduction to Artificial Intelligence And Japanese: Advanced II as my free electives, rather than taking easier first year classes which were offered as well.</p> ",
        "soccer":"<p>Out of all the sports I tried as I child, soccer is the one that stuck with me.</p><p>Not a very original choice as it is the most popular sport in the world, \"the sport of the people\". Even though it mostly started as a team sport I played as a child, as I grew up, I realized how complex the beautiful game actually is.</p> <p>By watching more and more games, and analyzing numerous actions, I realized how tactics work. Funnily I also enough, the world of soccer is a cruel world, as you can make all the \"right choices\", but the truth of the pitch prevails. What this means is that very small, seemingly unimportant events may snowball into game changing opportunities, for or against your team. I find the combination of tactical, psychological, technical and physical abilities absolutely fascinating, and it is why to this day, although I do not play as much as I used to, soccer is my favourite sport.</p> <p>I could not close this section without sharing the immense pride I feel for my country, as Morocco made history in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar by being the first African team to ever make it into the world cup semi-finals. Resilience, combativity, confidence and humility pushed our players to achieve this historical performance, as despite having all odds against them (drawing the \"group of death\" yet topping it, then facing Spain, Portugal, and the then world champion, France) they never lost faith.</p> <p>I aspire to be as fearless when facing challenges as my national team taught me.</p>",
        "gym": "<p>Although I started resistance training at the beginning of high school, I did not really like nor dislike it. I used to just go trough the motions of each workout, and I'm sure it was somewhat beneficial, but it isn't until University that I started falling in love with this activity.</p><p>What really made a difference for me was understanding and implementing progressive overload. If you are not familiar with this term, it means progressively overloading the stimuli on your muscles. In other words, it's attempting to always do slightly better than last time, whether it is by increasing the weights moved, the repetitions completed, or even just increasing the time under tension by controlling the eccentric. I started logging my performances, and tried to better myself lift after lift, workout after workout, week after week. This very addictive process is what made working out so appealing to me and it is why it plays an important part in my personal life.</p><p>The best part about this is that the progressive overload principle is applicable to all endeavours in life. You can chose to become a better person by doing more and more good deeds every day. You can chose to become a better programmer by genuinely attempting to better your code everyday. You can do anything you decide you want to do, and I believe this perspective is an overwhelmingly positive one.</p><p> As you probably understood, on top of the undeniable physiological benefit to working out, I believe there is a deeper more important effect it has on people that do it seriously. It considerably boosts self-esteem and confidence, making it valuable for mental health. But it also teaches very important qualities that most successful people tend to have, such as discipline, drive and dedication...</p>"
