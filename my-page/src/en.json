It's made to help them understand both what I'm good at for work and what kind of person I am transcending the confines of a conventional two-page résumé. </p><p> While resumes are undoubtedly valuable documents, they may sometimes fall short in providing a comprehensive representation of an individual. This website aims to present a more complete portrait of who I am as a professional and as a person. </p><p> I hope you enjoy browsing my web page.

        "wcc": "<p>This job marked my first steps into the professional world. Despite not being a coding position, I had the opportunity to learn a lot during this initial experience. </p><p> I was recruited for two main tasks: creating and updating web content on the University of Ottawa's website (using Drupal) and migrating information from professors' personal pages to a platform called Uniweb. </p><p> This allowed me to develop good habits of professional communication, both oral during meetings and written through emails. I also demonstrated my proactivity by participating in discussion panels for future students, in addition to my existing responsibilities, with the aim of constant progress within my role.",
        "wdev": "<p>During my second job, I was able to put my programming knowledge to the test. I was recruited with the goal of updating the self-help portal available on the Canada Post group of companies' intranet. </p><p> One of the most enjoyable aspects of this second experience was the freedom granted to me by my supervisor to carry out my tasks. This trustful relationship was solidified through productive exchanges, during which I presented the expected results, as well as ideas and perspectives for improvements. </p><p> One significant realization I had was that working on someone else's code is very different from working on your own code. This is something I quickly assimilated and which obviously served me well in my career since. </p><p> The last task I successfully completed was studying the daily traffic on the self-help portals to highlight their importance. I then created an alternative prototype to the conventional solution used up to that point (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), using a technology that is easier to maintain for non-programmers: SharePoint Online. </p><p> Finally, I had the opportunity to present all of this to some executives who were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the work provided by the COOP student I was.",
        "fstack": "<p>By far, my most impactful professional experience. I was recruited alongside another COOP student with the aim of delivering a web application to a client. </p><p> While our supervisor dedicated the majority of his time to another client project, we had a multitude of responsibilities to fulfill. </p><p> I had the fantastic opportunity to work on the project from start to finish, meeting clients, creating requirements and user stories, working on the backend, frontend, application testing, and also being involved in the deployment process. </p><p> Through our daily meetings, numerous pair programming sessions, and weekly sprints, the project followed a methodology blending SCRUM and Extreme Programming. </p><p> I emerged from this internship as a changed engineer, having made significant progress in technical, management, leadership, and various other hard and soft skills. At the beginning of my internship, I had never been exposed to C#, Angular or Azure DevOps, and the initial weeks proved to be quite challenging. However, through resilience and a desire for improvement, I quickly learned the technological stack and became a crucial member of the project. </p><p> I am extremely grateful to my supervisor, Youssef, for giving me this opportunity despite my lack of experience at the time of hiring. I believe I have repaid him with excellent results, a dedicated work ethic, and a positive and vibrant work atmosphere throughout the duration of my internship.",
        "capstone": "<p>My capstone project followed on from my COOP at Conceptio Technologies. Our client was our former requirements engineering professor, and our project was named SELEC (Système d’extraction de liens entre chercheurs, french for System for Extracting Links between Researchers). </p><p> Our client realized that the university had a wealth of data that was not being utilized and made available to research institutes. As applications for research funding became increasingly competitive, we decided to create a product that would leverage this data. The product previously used by the university (Uniweb) was sparsely populated and severely lacked information. </p><p> We quickly became aware of the existence of a recent project at the university called DataHub, and we were the first students to use it. We learned how to communicate with an external team for a common goal, which was not easy at first, but our collaboration with the DataHub team quickly became very positive. </p><p> We created a web application based on Boolean searches to return a list of researchers to the user. The technological stack used was C# for the backend, Angular for the frontend, Azure Synapse for pipelines, and SQL Server for the database. </p><p> The most significant skill I developed during my capstone project was collaboration with an external team. I believe this is an important skill in the professional world, as we often find ourselves working with teams other than our own, and clear communication of common goals is both important and more complex than it may seem. Indeed, other teams may have a different understanding than ours, and that's why I believe my experience during the capstone project has been very valuable. </p><p> At the end of our project, in addition to various presentations and demonstrations in class, we were able to present our product to the Vice-President of the OVPRI (Office of the Vice-President, Research and Innovation), as well as members of various research institutes. They were all pleased with the work done and provided us with feedback and their desire to have access to the application for use. </p><p> Another student is now in charge of closing our project.",
        "ra" : "<p>The only part-time experience on this list. I took over from another student as a research assistant. It's a project to digitize Cham dictionaries (an ancient Vietnamese language), during which I continued the work on Python scripts created by the former occupant of the position. I then created a simple user interface, still in Python, to help merge the two dictionaries into one large dictionary with the minimum possible duplicates. My last task, which I am still working on, is to change the source code of the open-source software named FieldWorks to add a unique feature to our project. </p><p> The technologies I used during this job are Python and C#. </p><p> The skills I had the opportunity to improve include regex, collaboration with an interdisciplinary team not familiar with programming (as they are linguists), as well as communication with FieldWorks developers."
